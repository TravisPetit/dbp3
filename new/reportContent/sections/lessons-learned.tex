\section{Lessons Learned}
The main lesson we learned during this project is not to underestimate how time consuming working with data is.
Both during the integration and the analysis phase, we were surprised by how long certain operations took and had to cut some corners.
The take away is not only to start earlier, but also to use better tools and put more thought into optimization up front when dealing with large datasets.
During the integration phase, we used python and looped through every single record individually and inserted them into the database one by one.
We believed that this would be the easiest way for us to go about it and that it would be sufficiently efficient since we still had quite a few days left before the deadline.
As it turned out, we very nearly didn't get done in time. If we had taken the time to use a more performant language and had put the work in to send batch updates to the SQL server, we likely could have cut down our execution time by a few orders of magnitude.

The problem during the analysis phase, which is laid out in the Methods section, was not so much a matter of us consciously making a decision that proved to be inefficient.
Rather, it was the result of an oversight we made when defining our database.
If we had forseen the need for the index on the dateoccurred field, the query that didn't finish in time for our report likely would not have taken more tha a few hours at most.

%Moving on, in terms of the data visalization, probably the most interesting fact we have seen is the margin by which the number of
